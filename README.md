# Simple Text Editor: the basics of object-oriented programming
## Purpose of work
Understand the basics of object-oriented programming. Get skills in
rewriting procedural/structural code into the object-oriented one. Understand and define the
benefits of using object-oriented paradigm comparing to procedural/structural paradigms.

## Task
Rewrite the existing code using object-oriented paradigm. </br>
Upgrade a console-based text editor with below functions:
1. Delete command
2. Undo command (3 steps, ignoring Save/Load commands)
3. Redo command (3 steps, ignoring Save/Load commands)
4. Cut/Copy/Paste commands
5. Insert with replacement command
6. (Optional) Implement cursor-based logic </br>
In this case the logic for cut, copy, paste, delete, insert and some other commands will be
based on the current cursor location.

## Control questions
1. What is object-oriented paradigm?
2. What is a class?
3. What is an object?
4. What is the difference between fields and methods?
5. Enumerate key object-oriented principles.
6. Explain benefits of using object-oriented paradigm comparing to procedural and structural.
7. Describe the program translation process from the source code to the final executable.
8. What is compiler responsible for?
9. What is a linker?
